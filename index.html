      Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788) in the 18th century posed and solved <br>
      the very first problem of geometric probability. A needle of a given length L is tossed<br>
      on a wooden floor with evenly spaced cracks, distance D apart. What is the probability <br>
      of the needle hitting a crack? (The problem is nowadays known as Buffon's Needle problem.)<br>
      The answer he discovered with the help of integral calculus is given by the simple formula <br>
      P = 2L/&pi;D <br>
      With P approximated by the ratio of hits to the total number of tosses, the formula offers a way <br>
      of evaluating &pi;, an observation that eventually led Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827) to propose <br>
      a method, known today as the Monte Carlo Method, for numerical evaluation of various quantities <br>
      by realizing appropriate random events.
      <br><br>
      History records several names of people who applied the method manually to approximate &pi;. <br>
      A Captain Fox indulged himself while recuperating from wounds incurred in the Civil War. <br>
      H. D&ouml;rrie mentions Wolf from Zurich (1850) who obtained &pi; = 3.1596 after 5000 throws, and the <br>
      Englishmen Smith (1855) and Fox (1864) who obtained &pi; = 3.1553 and &pi; = 3.1419 after 3200 and <br>
      1100 throws, respectively. The record is held by an Italian mathematician Lazzerini (1901), who <br>
      attained the accuracy of six decimal (3.1415929) digits after just 3408 throws. As there does not <br>
      appear any definite relationship between the number of throws and the accuracy of the approximation, <br>
      Lazzerini's success should probably be attributed to chance or luck as the case may be. <br>
      (The best Theory of Probability can do is to assure accuracy with a certain probability. <br>
      The expected accuracy may or may not be achieved in any particular set of experiments.)

      Start or resume a simulation with the <span class="start">Start<span> button. <br>
      Unless you enter a <span class="max-tosses">Number of Tosses</span> larger than 0, <br>
      the simulation runs until you hit the <span class="stop">Stop</span> button. <br>
      Create a new simulation ("Restart") with the <span class="new">New Simulation</span> button.
